# McGillAutoAddExtension

This small project is a Chrome extension tool that automates the "Quick Add" process on McGill's Minerva platform for students attempting to join a course that has limited space availability.

## Installation Instructions
This extension was developed for Google Chrome. Please make sure to have an up-to-date version of Google Chrome available.
1. Within this repository page, click on the green *Code* button near the top and select *Download ZIP*
2. Find the ZIP file in your file browser and unzip it to obtain a folder with all the necessary files
3. Navigate in Google Chrome to the "Extensions" page (More Tools > Extensions **OR** by directly putting *chrome://extensions/* in the address bar)
4. In the upper-right hand corner, enable *Developer mode*
5. Within the newly appearing menu bar, click on *Load unpacked* and select the folder unzipped in Step 2
6. The McGill Course Auto Quick Add Extension should now appear in your extensions, and be directly accessible through the Chrome browswer's top bar (extensions appear to the right of the address bar)
